"The International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of the Republic of South Africa notified WHO of 20 confirmed mpox cases between 8 May and 2 July 2024, including three deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) of 15%). These cases were reported in three of nine provinces: Gauteng (10 cases; 1 death), Western Cape (1 case), and KwaZulu-Natal (9 cases; 2 deaths). These are the first cases of mpox reported in South Africa since 2022 when the country had reported five cases, none of which were severe, and no deaths.

The persons affected are men aged between 17 and 43 years old, and of the first 16 cases, 11 self-identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). At least 15 cases are living with HIV with unmanaged or only recently diagnosed HIV infection, and have advanced HIV disease (AHD), and one case has diabetes. The type of exposure contact reported by cases is sexual contact.  Eighteen of the patients required hospitalization.

Several response measures have been put in place by national health authorities with the support of WHO. 

The sudden appearance of these cases none of whom reported any history of international travel, the extremely high HIV prevalence among confirmed cases, and the high case-fatality ratio suggest that the confirmed cases are only a small proportion of all cases that might have occurred, and that community transmission is ongoing.

The risk to human health for the general public remains low in the country. The risk for gay men, bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, trans and gender-diverse people, and sex workers is moderate. There is potential for increased health impact should wider dissemination among these and other vulnerable groups in South Africa and neighbouring countries continue.

This event emphasizes that the global mpox outbreak linked to clade IIb monkeypox virus (MPXV) is still ongoing, and the risk of cross-border and international spread persists in all WHO regions. ","causes:

"The IHR NFP of the Republic of South Africa notified WHO of 20 confirmed mpox (monkeypox) cases between 8 May and 2 July 2024, including three deaths (CFR 15%). These cases were reported in three of nine provinces: Gauteng (10 cases; 1 death), Western Cape (1 case), and KwaZulu-Natal (9 cases; 2 deaths).&nbsp;The cases are all male, aged between 17 and 43 years, and almost all self-identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). Most are persons living with HIV, with unmanaged or only recently diagnosed HIV infection and advanced HIV disease (AHD), and one has diabetes.&nbsp;All cases were symptomatic, with extensive skin lesions and 18 required hospitalization. None of the confirmed cases reported a history of international travel and none reported attending high-risk social gatherings. The type of exposure reported by cases is sexual contact.&nbsp;For the first 16 cases overall, 44 contacts were identified in KwaZulu-Natal, 39 contacts in Western Cape, and 55 in Gauteng province. While three of the four initial cases in KwaZulu-Natal were epidemiologically linked through contact tracing, at least the initial seven in Gauteng province were not found to be epidemiologically linked, suggesting community transmission is underway. &nbsp;Individual contact tracing for recent cases is ongoing.&nbsp;In addition, limited information suggests that some affected persons have attended and been exposed to mpox at parties or clubs where sexual activity occurs.Genomic sequencing, available for five confirmed cases has identified sub-clade IIb MPXV, the clade linked to the multi-country mpox outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the ongoing 2022-2024 multi-country outbreak, five mpox cases had previously been confirmed in South Africa, during the peak in June-August 2022, and all had reported travel abroad.

"Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade; and clade II, previously called the West African clade, which includes subclades IIa and IIb. MPXV transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat. Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week of exposure but can start 1&ndash;21 days later. Symptoms typically last 2&ndash;4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems are at risk of developing complications and death from mpox.It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may have chickenpox. For these reasons, laboratory testing of skin specimens obtained by swabbing is important for confirmation of mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area, and implementation of public health and social measures to curb transmission.Treatment is based primarily on managing clinical symptoms, ensuring skin care, reducing pain, and preventing and managing complications. Where available through emergency or compassionate use programmes, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications.","causes:

"The sudden appearance of unlinked cases of mpox in South Africa without a history of international travel, the high HIV prevalence among confirmed cases, and the high case fatality ratio suggest that community transmission is underway, and the cases detected to date represent a small proportion of all mpox cases that might be occurring in the community; it is unknown how long the virus may have been circulating. This may in part be due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infection with which South Africa previously gained little experience during the ongoing global outbreak, potential pauci-symptomatic manifestation of the disease, or delays in care-seeking behaviour due to limited access to care or fear of stigma.&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, most of the transmission in the initial cases is linked to recent sexual contacts among men, similar to the spread in newly affected countries during the 2022-2024 multi-country outbreak. For most confirmed cases, no epidemiological link has been established, possibly due in part to incomplete contact identification. This suggests that undetected community transmission is occurring and that further cases can be expected as surveillance is strengthened. The current risk to human health for the general public remains low in the country. The risk for gay men, bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, trans and gender diverse people, and sex workers is moderate, as currently assessed for the global outbreak. The higher risk assessment is consistent with ongoing transmission among recognized risk groups due mainly to exposure through sexual contact, and the higher prevalence of undetected or uncontrolled HIV infection in the country which also puts people at risk of severe disease. There is potential for increased health impact should wider dissemination continue in vulnerable groups in South Africa or neighbouring countries. Data from ongoing mpox outbreaks show that the risk of severe disease and death is higher among children, immunocompromised individuals including persons with poorly controlled HIV, and pregnant women.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) data estimate HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men in South Africa to be around 30%, only 44% of whom are on antiretroviral therapy. This makes this group extremely vulnerable to severe mpox disease and death. There is also a hazard to health workers if they are not appropriately using personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with mpox.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 2022, the CFR for clade II MPXV in West Africa was estimated to be 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%, 6.8%). Case fatality in the ongoing multi-country outbreak (0.2%) is the lowest recorded for MPXV clade II. In contrast, the CFR among cases reported in South Africa in 2024 is extremely high (15%), as most detected cases are among persons who are immunocompromised with uncontrolled HIV and other co-morbidities. Persons with less severe mpox are less likely to recognize the condition or seek diagnosis and care; therefore, such cases may remain undetected and unreported.&nbsp;Vaccination with mpox vaccines has been shown to be effective against mpox. The last case of smallpox in South Africa was reported in 1972, and smallpox vaccination stopped shortly after the global eradication of the disease in 1980. Thus, any immunity from prior smallpox vaccination (which is cross-protective for mpox) will at best now only be present in some persons over the age of 44 years. The median age of mpox cases in the current global outbreak is 34 years (IQR: 29 - 41) and within South Africa, reported cases are aged between 17-43 years.&nbsp;The limited awareness of mpox and lack of knowledge about practices for prevention among health workers and among key populations such as sex workers or men who have sex with men in the country exacerbates their risk for mpox. Anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including mpox, may experience fear and stigma, which can be further compounded for key populations.&nbsp;There is concern that the mpox outbreak in South Africa will continue to evolve given:&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;high likelihood of under-detection and under-reporting&nbsp;of local transmission, given that reported cases have to date almost exclusively affected the most vulnerable.Currently, all detected cases have presented with severe&nbsp;disease and extensive skin lesions, which could lead to more viral transmission and risks poor outcomes for the patients.&nbsp;While the government and partners are mobilized to introduce treatment for affected patients and vaccines for people at risk, these countermeasures are&nbsp;not yet widely available in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public awareness&nbsp;of mpox&nbsp;and information about modes of transmission or possible amplifying events or risk of exposure in sex-on-premises venues remains&nbsp;limited in South Africa. &nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent&nbsp;outbreaks of mpox are occurring in Africa and elsewhere, increasing the risk of further transmission.&nbsp;","causes:

"General&nbsp;Health authorities and clinicians/health and care workers of all countries should be aware that the global mpox outbreak linked to clade IIb MPXV is ongoing in all WHO regions and the risk of cross-border and international spread exists.&nbsp;National reporting to WHO is less complete and timely in recent months, and the number of cases continues to be underestimated globally.WHO strongly advises that countries continue to follow the Standing Recommendations issued by the Director-General in August 2023, particularly concerning the epidemiological surveillance of mpox. Countries should continue to strengthen the availability of and access to laboratory diagnostics in line with updated WHO interim guidance, including genomic sequencing of viruses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash &ndash; skin, fluid or crusts &ndash; collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample confirms mpox, a negative result is not enough to rule out MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended. Serology does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses and is therefore restricted to reference laboratories where antibody detection methods may be applied for retrospective case classification or in special studies. There must be sustained implementation of risk communication and community engagement appropriate to each context, maintenance or initiation of vaccination for persons at risk, optimal case management, adherence to infection control measures, strengthening research to better appreciate modes of transmission in different contexts, and sustained support for the development of rapid diagnostic methods and treatments adapted to the needs of patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;Health authorities should strive to achieve the elimination of human-to-human transmission of mpox and ensure the maintenance of capacity for outbreak response.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of mpox should follow the instructions of health authorities according to the local context, including isolation during the infectious period. Contacts of a confirmed case are asked to limit their movements (and advised to abstain from sexual relations) for 21 days, the monitoring period for the appearance of possible symptoms.&nbsp;Vaccination against mpox is recommended for people possibly at risk of contracting the disease.&nbsp;Specific antiviral treatments are currently being assessed for efficacy against mpox, such as tecovirimat. Access to tecovirimat is possible through national application for use under the WHO MEURI protocol or request to WHO for access to the reserve for compassionate use.&nbsp;It is essential to deepen knowledge in different contexts on optimal case management in the event of mpox and HIV co-infection, especially for patients who must initiate antiretroviral treatment. In the community&nbsp;Risk communication and community engagement activities are vital in motivating affected communities to become aware of the risks and protective behaviours, and to understand, prevent and combat stigma and discrimination. In this outbreak, there is continuing risk of exposure to mpox in the community through sexual activity in high-risk settings where multiple sexual contacts may occur.Key audiences should be identified and advice provided to health professionals, community organizations, managers of events and sex-on-premises venues, key populations including commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, trans and gender-diverse individuals, people working at or attending venues and events where sexual activity takes place, and people at risk of more serious illness (including persons living with untreated or poorly controlled HIV infection).&nbsp;To keep venues safe, a risk-based approach is recommended, including risk evaluation, risk mitigation and risk communication for personnel and clients, accompanied by rigorous environmental infection prevention and control practices. Patients without severe disease who can isolate at home should be given advice on how to care for themselves. This includes advice for taking care of the rash (don't scratch, clean your hands before and after touching lesions, keep your rash clean with sterilized water/antiseptic etc.) and supporting the patient&rsquo;s mental health (keep hydrated, eat well, get enough sleep, use medication for pain and fever if needed, do things you find relaxing/enjoyable etc.) Mental health and psychosocial support are essential for patients with mpox in all settings regardless of context. The details on public health advice on recovering from mpox at home are accessible in this link. Health and care workers who provide care to patients in the community and/or household settings should refer to WHO Interim Rapid Response Guidance on case management and infection prevention and control for mpox for guidance on the IPC measures recommended. It is vital that infection control measures be implemented to prevent and stop transmission of mpox in household and community settings that may amplify risk.In healthcare settings&nbsp;Implementing IPC measures in health care settings is necessary to prevent and stop the transmission of mpox. It is important to train staff on mpox and the appropriate control measures, such as standard and transmission-based precautions. Staff should also have access to and appropriately wear personal protective equipment, adhere to the WHO 5 Moments for hand hygiene, ensure frequent cleaning and disinfection of the patient environment, and implement appropriate patient placement and isolation. For further guidance on IPC measures required when caring for patients with mpox, please refer to WHO interim guidance Clinical Management and Infection Prevention and Control for monkeypox.While protecting themselves with recommended measures, health and care workers should also ensure that stigmatization of patients with mpox is avoided and that psychological support is provided to patients and their families.&nbsp;At points of entry&nbsp;It is recommended to encourage authorities, health and care workers and community groups to provide travellers with relevant information to protect themselves and others before, during and after travel to events or gatherings where mpox may present a risk.&nbsp;WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions based on available information on the current outbreak. As not all viral genomes from these cases have yet been sequenced, and there is known extensive commercial and professional exchange between South Africa and central Africa, it is also critical to remain vigilant regarding the possibility of importation of clade I strains to South Africa.&nbsp;","causes:
1. incomplete and untimely national reporting to who
2. limited availability of laboratory diagnostics and genomic sequencing of viruses
3. lack of sustained implementation of risk communication and community engagement
4. insufficient knowledge on optimal case management in the event of mpox and hiv co-infection
5. lack of access to specific antiviral treatments like tecovirimat

effects:
1. underestimation of the number of cases globally
2. risk of cross-border and international spread of mpox
3. continuing risk of exposure to mpox in the community through sexual activity in high-risk settings
4. amplification of risk in household and community settings due to lack of infection control measures
5. stigmatization of patients with mpox and their families
6. lack of protection for travellers against mpox during events or gatherings where it may present a risk."

"In December 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a national outbreak of mpox and an incident management system has been in place since February 2023, based on the increasing number of reported cases.   

Since September 2023, an outbreak of mpox in South Kivu province has continued to spread within the province and recently to neighbouring North Kivu, driven by sexual contact transmission. A new variant of clade I MPXV has been described in South Kivu. It carries predominantly APOBEC3-type mutations, indicating adaptation of the virus due to circulation among humans. It was estimated to have emerged around mid-September 2023, and its human-to-human transmission has been ongoing since then. This is the first documented sustained community transmission of the virus in the country.   

It is not known if this variant is more transmissible or leads to more severe disease than other clade I MPXV strains. Additionally, it carries gene deletions that affect diagnostics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, only clade I MPXV has been detected in the country, which in the WHO African region, reports the highest number of cases. 

In 2024, as of 26 May, a total of 7 851 mpox cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 384 deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 4.9%). These cases were reported in 177 of the 519 (34%) health zones across 22 out of the 26 provinces (85%).  

The continuing development of the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains concerning due to the continuing high incidence of mpox reported in endemic areas of the country in recent years with high case fatality, the geographic expansion to previously unaffected areas, the appearance of a novel strain of clade I MPXV, the observed sustained community transmission driven by sexual transmission and other forms of close physical contact in the eastern part of the country, resource constraints to respond over such a wide geographic area, limited public awareness of mpox, the insufficient availability of treatment kits and lack of vaccines to date, multiple competing public health priorities, and insecurity. Based on the situation, WHO assesses that the risk associated with mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains high.  ","causes:

"Since 2022, an epidemic of mpox caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV) clade IIb has been ongoing globally, affecting many countries outside the African continent that had never reported mpox previously. Its spread has been mainly driven and sustained by transmission via sexual contact among men who have sex with men, who represent the most affected group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, MPXV strains circulating in Democratic Republic of the Congo belong to clade I, and no cases of MPXV clade IIb have so far been detected, an increase of reported cases, as well as a geographical expansion of their distribution, has been observed in the country since 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission due to sexual contact of MPXV clade I was first formally documented in April 2023 in a small cluster of cases in Kwango province, as mentioned in the previous Disease Outbreak News report.&nbsp;The occurrence of sexual transmission of MPXV clade I was further established by the reporting in September 2023 of several new cases exposed through sexual contact with a known case in Kamituga health zone, in South Kivu province. Since then, the number of cases reported in South Kivu has continued to increase, including among sex workers and their contacts, and from an increasing number of health zones. Case investigations and subsequent outbreak investigations together with virus genetics confirm the sustained human-to-human transmission of MPXV clade I in the area without suspected animal exposure.&nbsp;On 1 June 2024, the first case of mpox was confirmed in North Kivu Province, in Karisimbi Health Zone in the city of Goma[1]. A 19-year-old woman presented with a macular skin rash, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysuria (pain on urination), headache and genital lesions. PCR of swabs from the skin lesions tested positive for MPXV. A total of 45 contacts are being followed-up. In-depth epidemiological investigation identified a sexual contact with suspected mpox and a travel history to South Kivu Province. The contact reportedly traveled onwards to Masisi Health Zone, North Kivu, where the investigation continues. The case of mpox in Goma, North Kivu, which is characterized by insecurity, is the first ever reported case in that province.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, in 2023, a total of 14 626 mpox cases and 654 deaths (CFR) 4.5%) were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, representing the highest figures in the recorded in the country and the highest among countries in the WHO African Region. Among these cases, 1 461 (10%) were laboratory-tested, of which 966 were positive (test positivity, 68%).&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2024, as of 26 May, a total of 7 851 mpox cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 384 deaths (CFR 4.9%). These cases were reported in 177 of the 519 (34%) health zones across 22 out of the 26 provinces (85%). The new case in Goma raises this to 23 of 26 (88%) provinces. The most affected provinces in 2024 are Equateur, Sud Ubangi, Sankuru and South Kivu (Figure 1).&nbsp;Figure 1.

Of these, 994 were laboratory-confirmed as positive for MPXV, representing test positivity of 70%. Among the provinces with reported mpox cases in 2024, 15 out of 22 (68%) have confirmed at least one case this year (Figure 2). Among confirmed cases with the information available, 59% (502 of 852) are male; 50% of confirmed cases are under 15 years of age (Figure 3). &nbsp;Figure 2.

As of 26 May 2024, 18% (1 415 of 7 851) of all reported cases had been tested. Supported by expanded testing capacity, this represents an 80% increase compared to the 10% of reported cases tested in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 4.

However, cases confirmed by GeneXpert in 2024 have not yet been included in the national case count pending completion of GeneXpert test validation exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, only clade I MPXV has been detected in the country. In late 2023, testing for clade II MPXV was introduced in the national laboratory and is used for new cases/clusters in previously unaffected provinces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New variant detected in South Kivu&nbsp;In South Kivu, between 1 January and 2 June 2024, 777 cases were reported through the national surveillance system after investigation of alerts. Following laboratory testing of samples from 426 out of 777 cases (55%), 373 cases were confirmed as positive (test positivity of 88%), including seven deaths (CFR 1.8% among confirmed cases).&nbsp; &nbsp;The mpox cluster in South Kivu, initially detected in the Kamituga Health Zone and driven by sexual contact transmission, has been expanding geographically and currently 19 of 34 (56%) health zones have reported at least one mpox case.&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of contact reported by cases includes sexual contact, non-sexual direct contact, as well as household and healthcare facility contact. No cases with suspected zoonotic transmission have been reported in the province since the start of the outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of laboratory confirmed cases in South Kivu are among persons aged more than 15 years, and among those with age and sex data available, the sex distribution is similar, with 51% female and 49% male.&nbsp;Through genomic sequencing of MPXV samples collected between October 2023 and January 2024, a novel variant of clade I MPXV was identified in the Kamituga health zone. This variant carries a deletion of a gene that widely serves as a target for clade-specific molecular assays. This deletion was confirmed by the national reference laboratory, the Institut National de Recherche Biom&eacute;dicale (INRB), as well as other academic and public health institutes.&nbsp;The new variant was found to have predominantly APOBEC3-type mutations, indicating adaptation of the virus due to circulation among humans. It was estimated to have emerged around mid-September 2023, with sequence data suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission since then. It is not known if this variant is more transmissible or leads to more severe disease than other virus strains circulating in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;All publicly available virus sequences from clinical specimens from South Kivu in 2024 identify the strain to be the novel variant. However, in all other publicly available sequences from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including recent sequences from Equateur, Kinshasa and Tshopo, there is no evidence of APOBEC-3 type mutations. With the publicly available data, it remains unclear whether this novel variant evolved in South Kivu or in other under-sampled regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the larger Congo Basin area. Additional sequencing data from across the country and the larger Congo Basin area are needed to better understand the origins of this novel variant, and better understand all virus strains circulating in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mpox situation in WHO Africa Region&nbsp;Burundi&nbsp;Verbal reports of suspected mpox cases have suggested potential cross-border transmission from South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As of 30 May 2024, no suspected mpox case has been officially reported from Burundi. An assessment of the national level of preparedness for mpox has been conducted, procurement of testing kits and inventory of medical stocks are ongoing. Discussions to develop a mpox contingency plan are also ongoing.&nbsp;Cameroon&nbsp;From 1 January to 30 April 2024, there have been 23 suspected cases of mpox, with five confirmed cases (four males and one female) and two deaths (40% CFR). Genomic sequencing of these cases has identified clade II as the responsible variant. Over the years, Cameroon remains to date the only country to have reported both clades I and II MPXV. In 2024 the confirmed cases are distributed across three regions Nord-Ouest (n=2), Sud-Ouest (n=2), and Littoral (n=1) regions, highlighting the potential for regional spread.&nbsp;Republic of the Congo (ROC)&nbsp;On 23 April 2024, the government declared a national mpox epidemic, activating the Centre d&rsquo;op&eacute;rations d&rsquo;urgence de sant&eacute; publique (COUSP) and the Incident Management System on 3 May 2024. Genomic sequencing of MPXV samples confirmed clade I, similar to those found in endemic neighbouring areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. From 1 January to 30 May 2024, the Republic of Congo reported 19 confirmed and 10 probable mpox cases across four departments: Cuvette (14 cases), Likouala (two cases), Plateaux (two cases), and Pointe-Noire (one case). The modes of transmission for these cases have not been documented. As a result, there's a high risk of the outbreak spreading. The outbreak peaked during week 4 to 10 (from 21 January to 9 March) 2024, and no cases have been reported in more recent weeks. However, only 9 of the 35 suspected cases recorded in week 21 were tested (all negative), highlighting a low testing rate.&nbsp;Rwanda&nbsp;Given the proximity to South Kivu, preparedness activities have been ongoing in the country. Surveillance has been strengthened in districts bordering Bukavu. Between 28 April and 4 May 2024, teams from Rwanda Biomedical Centre, CDC, IOM and University of Rwanda (FETP residents) conducted mpox active case search, assessment of points of entry and health facilities readiness to detect and respond to mpox outbreaks, health worker sensitization and community awareness within Rusizi and Nyamasheke districts. As of 4 May 2024, 16 suspected cases were recorded from Rusizi (15) and Nyamasheke (1) districts. All the cases tested negative for mpox by PCR. The national mpox contingency plan is under finalization.&nbsp;South Africa&nbsp;From 1 January to 6 June 2024, five confirmed mpox cases have been reported, all of whom are men aged between 35 and 39 years old. All five cases have been sequenced as clade IIb MPXV. Two cases were reported in Gauteng province, and a cluster of three cases in KwaZulu-Natal province. The cases in these two clusters did not report any international travel history. Four of the five men initiated treatment with tecovirimat provided by WHO from the limited reserve for compassionate use, upon request of the Government of South Africa. The severity of all the cases identified in persons with immune suppressions suggests less severe cases are not being identified, tested or reported. Outbreak response is underway in collaboration with the HIV/AIDS control programme, including contact-tracing and clinician training. There is extensive travel between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, linked to commercial and professional activity between the two countries.","causes:

"Mpox (monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade; and clade II, previously called the West Africa clade, which includes subclades IIa and clade IIb. MPXV transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat.&nbsp;Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 1&ndash;21 days after exposure. Symptoms typically last 2&ndash;4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems are at risk of developing complications and death from mpox.&nbsp;It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, laboratory testing is important for confirmation of mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area, and implementation of relevant public health and social measures to curb transmission.&nbsp;Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash &ndash; skin, fluid or crusts &ndash; collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample confirms mpox, a negative result is not enough to rule out MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended. Serology does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses and is therefore restricted to reference laboratories where antibody detection methods may be applied for retrospective case classification or in special studies.&nbsp;Treatment is based on skin scare, managing pain, and preventing complications. In addition, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications.","causes:
