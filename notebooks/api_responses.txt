1. Raw text with marked causes and effects:
Although no cases of WNV have been documented in birds or horses in the country, it is possible that the virus is circulating in these populations undetected. Despite this, the overall impact on public health remains limited at this stage, as there is currently only one recorded human case and appropriate public health response measures have been implemented, as described above. The risk of international dissemination of WNV from Barbados is low. The virus is primarily transmitted through (C1) mosquito bites (C1), with (C2) birds as the natural hosts (C2). There is no evidence to suggest that WNV spreads easily between humans or from horses to mosquitoes.

2. Extracted causes and effects:
C1: mosquito bites -> E1: transmission of the virus, Causality type: T1
C2: birds as the natural hosts -> E1: transmission of the virus, Causality type: T1

However, the (E1) potential for international transmission (E1) is increased due to the fact that the (C1) individual visited Pakistan (C1), while a (C1) high-risk contact traveled to South Asia within the 14-day follow-up period (C1). Both individuals had arranged their travels prior to the occurrence of the event and before the test results of the case were obtained and disseminated. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where (E2) MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries (E2). In addition, cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through (C2) contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk) (C2), or in a (C2) health-care setting (C2).

2. Extracted causes and effects:
C1: individual visited Pakistan -> E1: potential for international transmission, Causality type: T3
C1: high-risk contact traveled to South Asia within the 14-day follow-up period -> E1: potential for international transmission, Causality type: T3

Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur if there are (C1) delays in identifying the infection (C1), particularly in countries that are not well-acquainted with the disease, as well as (C1) slow triage of suspected cases (C1) and (C1) delays in the implementation of standard infection prevention and control measures (C1). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.

2. Extracted causes and effects:
C1: delays in identifying the infection -> E1: Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV, Causality type: T3

Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis. The notification of 26 confirmed cases, of which over 70% are healthcare workers from two different health facilities in the country is of great concern. (C1) Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease (C1) can lead to (E1) further spread (E1) if not controlled early. The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized.

1. Raw text with marked causes and effects:
This is the first human case of infection with a zoonotic influenza virus notified by Ghana. Laboratory testing confirmed the virus as an influenza A(H9N2) virus. The majority of human infections with A(H9N2) viruses occur due to (C1) contact with infected poultry or environments that have been contaminated (C1) and typically result in (E1) mild clinical symptoms (E1). Further human cases in persons with exposure to the virus in infected animals or through contaminated environments can be expected since the (C2) virus continues to be detected in poultry populations (C2).

2. Extracted causes and effects:
C1: contact with infected poultry or environments that have been contaminated -> E1: mild clinical symptoms, Causality type: T1
C2: virus continues to be detected in poultry populations -> E2: further human cases can be expected, Causality type: T1



API Response for Article ID 2024-DON534: 
1. Raw text with marked causes and effects:
To date, there has been no reported sustained human-to-human transmission humans of A(H9N2) viruses. The existing epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that (C1) this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans (C1). Thus, the (E1) likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low (E1). Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their (C2) infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival (C2).

2. Extracted causes and effects:
C1: this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans -> E1: likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low, Causality type: T1

1. Raw text with marked causes and effects:
Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses have been reported in recent years from many countries. Most human cases with influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection result from (C1) exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine (C1) or (C1) indirectly through contaminated environments (C1). However, a few cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset.

2. Extracted causes and effects:
C1: exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine -> E1: human cases with influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection, Causality type: T3
C1: indirectly through contaminated environments -> E1: human cases with influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection, Causality type: T3



API Response for Article ID 2024-DON532: 
1. Raw text with marked causes and effects:
Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses has been described, although ongoing community transmission has never been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans.
