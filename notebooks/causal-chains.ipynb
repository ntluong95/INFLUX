      "As part of the ongoing efforts to monitor and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, on 12 February 2024, the World Health Organization conducted a Rapid Risk Assessment for yellow fever. It aimed to reassess the current regional risk of multiple ongoing YF outbreaks, in the context of a resurgence of YF outbreaks in countries with a history of preventive vaccination campaigns and (C1) persisting immunity gaps (C1), including capacities to support the response (e.g., technical capacities, vaccine supply and vaccination campaigns, laboratory and operations, support and logistics (OSL)) and to provide recommendations for a more effective and coordinated response. The overall risk at the regional level was re-assessed as moderate based on several contributing factors observed in the region despite the efforts to control the spread of YF: Stable number of ongoing outbreaks across the region. (C2) Persistence of pockets of unimmunized populations (C2) although considerable efforts have been made in recent years to protect the population through PMVC and reactive mass vaccination campaigns (RMVC). Detection of YF confirmed cases in urban areas, such as Douala city in Cameroon, which pose significant risks due to (C3) high population density (C3) and (C3) international travel connections (C3), noting nevertheless the risk mitigation provided by a relatively high average vaccination coverage. (C4) Risk of cross-border spread (C4), particularly from the outbreak in South Sudan, which shares borders with neighbouring countries. (C5) Limited surveillance and laboratory capacity (C5) in certain regions may result in (E1) delayed detection, underestimation of the extent of the disease and delayed response (E1). Persisting response challenges with the case classification, investigation, and response operations, exacerbated by (C6) competing health emergencies (C6). (C7) Competing outbreaks (C7) strain the capacity to respond effectively, with various simultaneous health crises, including measles, poliomyelitis, mpox, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis E, Lassa fever, and dengue. These challenges are compounded by factors such as (C8) food insecurity (C8), (C8) security constraints (C8), and (C8) complex humanitarian contexts (C8).\n",
