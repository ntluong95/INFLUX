Infants and children under five years of age are at highest risk of severe disease and death, **particularly where prompt optimal case management is limited or unavailable**. The number of cases reported weekly remains consistently high while the outbreak continues to expand geographically. High test positivity among tested cases in most provinces also suggests that undetected transmission is likely ongoing in the community. Transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV via **sexual contact** in key populations was first identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023. In South Kivu province, mpox transmission is sustained through **human-to-human contact (sexual and non-sexual)**\n"
